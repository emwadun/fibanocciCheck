## fibanocciCheck.py is the main python file. 

Below find the overall flow of regarding its implementations:

*1. It imports a module **'generateFibanocciSequence.py'** that I created. This module generates Fibanocci numbers. You can check more details about this module by checking the inline comments in it.*

*2. It prints all the Fibanocci numbers from the module **'generateFibanocciSequence.py'.***

*3. It then stores the Fibanocci numbers in a list.*

*4. We then call a function named **checkFibanocci** that does the following:*

  *-[x] Prompts the user for an integer*

  *-[x] Checks if the number entered by the user is a Fibanocci number and gives response to the user if the number is a Fibanocci number or not.*
